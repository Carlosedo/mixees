Cocktail and Mix Database

This is a Pet Project to try out new and interesting technologies
=================================================================

So far I've used,

* Django, for the project's backend.
* Scrapy, to build a web scraper and feed the data directly to Django's database. [Link](https://github.com/Carlosedo/scraptails)
* Vue.js, for the project's frontend, especially the cocktail maker.
* Elasticsearch, to provide search functionality.
* GraphQL, so far just as a proof of concept.

And some more to come!
